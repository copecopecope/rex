To run the program for a given month, call:

```
python3 rex.py YEAR MONTH
```

Where month is not zero-padded. This is in python 3, but depending on how your python env is set up, you may just use `python`. For missing modules use `pip3` (or, again depending on your env, `pip`).

Use `p` and `n` (or enter) to move between entries and the up and down arrow keys to scroll. To skip an entry (if it's not an actual review) type `s`. Type `q` to quit. If you quit with Ctrl+C, it will NOT save your progress, so don't do it.
