FISHTAILS suggests to my ear that the words will follow, not precede FISH, but whatever; it works. Had the most trouble with GRAPE JELLY, first because I wouldn't let that stuff anywhere near my sandwich, second, because the clue should have read ""spread,"" not ""filler"" (gross), and lastly, because the SE was just kind of a mess. I had TUILE and TOILE before I finally got TULLE (?) for <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">51D: Veil material</span> (me and fabrics ... don't get along). Further, I could not think of any ""Mae"" but FANNIE, so <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">64A: _____ Mae (college money provider)</span> eluded me in eel-like fashion for a few beats down there. Oh, and JAL (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">61D: Major Asian carrier, for short</span>) - which I assume stands for Japan Airlines - was unknown to me. I've never been to Japan - or Asia, period, for that matter. Wow, is that true? Yes it is.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">28A: Tiebreakers, briefly (OTs)</span> - not always. I think of a ""tie-breaker"" as something that Definitely breaks a tie, not a period of time during which a tie might be broken.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">39D: Frequent flier's reward (free trip)</span> - not always. Sometimes you get upgrades.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">38A: You might R.S.V.P. online to this (e-Vite) </span>- I'm not sure which letter gets capitalized; the way I have it makes the answer look like the brand name of a vitamin drink. This answer is creeping into more and more puzzles. The Internet has been a Massive Boon to the crossword constructing industry.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">35A: It lets things go (releaser)</span> - yikes! Horrible odd-job answer.
