I had the ""DO NOT disturb"" answer before I had any of the theme answers filled in, then PARISH HOUSE (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">17A: Rectory</span>) became clear, and it didn't take me more than a couple of seconds to figure out what was up. Then I did something I almost never do - I hunted down every theme answer, feeling very confident that knowing ""SHH"" was in there somewhere would allow me to nail them with little-to-no-help. I was half right. Able to get most of them with no crosses, except ROSH HASHANA (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">65A: Feast of Trumpets</span>), which required a bunch, though it shouldn't have. ROSH HASHANA contained two squares I was uncertain of, mainly because HASHANA looked like it wanted to have at least one ""O"" in it, and two of the ""A"" crosses were utterly unknown to me:<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">52D: Hendryx of the group Labelle (Nona)</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">61D: Bird in ""The Lion King"" (Zazu)</span><br /><br />I figured the woman's name couldn't be ""No-No"" (could it?) and ZAZU's is the name of a local restaurant and caterer here in Confluence (though I may have the spelling wrong), so I stuck with the ""A""s. So when the Times applet rejected my grid, I set out to change the vowels in HASHANA to see which one(s) I had wrong. Turns out: none. I'd just made a transcription typo, and a good one: ASS HEAP for ASH HEAP (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">40A: Worthless pile</span>).<br /><br />The two other ""SHH"" answers in the puzzle were:<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">10D: Sprigs from the garden (fresh herbs) </span>and<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">30D: Deli selections (polish hams)</span><br /><br />A couple of pretty lame plurals, but o well. I still enjoyed the theme, overall.<br /><br />Primary reason I'm inclined to LOVE this puzzle? Because it took an answer I normally hate to see...<br /><br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/217/463991412_3ce8f834b3_o.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/217/463991412_3ce8f834b3_o.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">7D: Dominican-American major-league slugger, to fans (A-Rod)</span><br /><br />and made it delicious to me simply by crossing it with the aptest of words...<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">14A: Made an overthrow, say (erred)</span><br /><br />Few things delight my friend Matt and me more than watching A-ROD ERR.
