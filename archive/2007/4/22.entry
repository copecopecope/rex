I solved it in very leisurely fashion (such that my handwriting is actually legible) - a bit just before dinner, and then the rest while sitting on the couch watching the latest episode of ""The Riches"" (our newest TV addiction). What I'm most impressed by in this puzzle ... well, there are two things. One is that the non-theme fill is Great, with Scrabbly letters in odd places and some highly original pop culture clues and about half a dozen answers I just didn't know. The other, more impressive feature of the puzzle is that only one of the quotations about poetry made me want to vomit. The rest were FRESH and striking and didn't sound like they came out of the mouth of some poser beatnik or touchy-feely earth mother type. See if you can guess which one I did NOT like. The answer may surprise you:<br /><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">25A: With 36-Across, ""Poetry is..."" (Osbert Sitwell) </span>[uh ... who?] <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">(""... like fish. If it's / fresh it's good"")</span></li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">59A: ""Poetry is ...""

Cummings) (""... being not doing"")</span></li></ul>Apparently the ""e. e. cummings"" spelling of that poet's name is more publisher decision than anything else - lower-case spelling highlighted Cummings' disregard for conventions of capitalization in his poetry, but it did not reflect his own preference for how his name should be spelled.<br /><br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en/thumb/4/4e/220px-Bart_Sells_His_Soul.png""><img style=""margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en/thumb/4/4e/220px-Bart_Sells_His_Soul.png"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a>The following is one of the more memorable exchanges of all time between Bart and Lisa Simpson - from episode 3F02 of ""The Simpsons"" (""Bart Sells His Soul""). After Bart sells his soul to Milhouse for $5, he begins to lose many of his more positive human traits, including his ability to laugh (also, his ability to be detected by automatic sliding-glass door sensors, but that's another story). After watching a particularly gruesome ""Itchy & Scratchy"" cartoon, which would normally make him howl with laughter, Bart has no reaction. This sets up the following conversation with Lisa, who has been haranguing her disbelieving brother about the perils of selling his soul.<br /><pre style=""font-family: georgia;""><b>Bart: </b>I know that's funny, but I'm just not laughing.

He's not exactly a Hall-of-Famer. From Wikipedia - this is the LEAD info on his professional career:<br /><blockquote>Peete did not achieve stardom in his professional career in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"" title=""National Football League"">National Football League</a> (NFL), but he did play well enough to sustain his place in the league for 16 seasons, primarily as a back-up. His career was also riddled with injuries. He was drafted with the 141st pick of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_NFL_Draft"" title=""1989 NFL Draft"">1989 NFL Draft</a> by the Detroit Lions</blockquote>Not exactly the stuff of legend. He's better known for his work on ""The Best Damn Sports Show Period"" and for being married to actress Holly Robinson. And even with that, he's pretty damned obscure for a crossword.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">95A: Russian city or oblast (Orel)</span> - well not only do I not know what OREL is, I don't know what ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblast"">oblast</a>"" is (an old Soviet administrative division).<br /><br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/181/468274669_f331baa0e9_o.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/181/468274669_f331baa0e9_o.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a><br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6f/MrKitePoster.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6f/MrKitePoster.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">119A: Title character in a ""Sgt.

I've never listened to ""Sgt. Pepper"" In My Life. The song in question is entitled ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!""<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">136A: Sing ""Gladly the cross-eyed bear,"" say (garble)</span> - I only just now, just this second, got this. I was like ""Who the hell is this bear? What's the bear's name supposed to be?"" - but no, the clue is a GARBLEd version of ""Gladly the Cross I'd Bear,"" which must be the name of a hymn or something ... right? Damned atheistic upbringing!<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">154A: #24 of 24 (omega)</span> - or the last of any set, really. The wolf on the bottom of the pack hierarchy is called the ""Omega Wolf"" (as opposed to the ""Alpha"" at the top).

Yesterday's ""scoreboard"": BOS 7, NYY 5.

The conventional spelling is CAESURA. Nice to have a poetic answer in a poetry-theme puzzle. The C(a)ESURA is an important feature of Anglo-Saxon poetry, every line of which has a strong one right in the middle. C(a)ESURA and alliteration are probably Anglo-Saxon poetry's most defining characteristics. Anglo-Saxon = pre-Norman Invasion.

This is the second time we've seen her this week. ENID is also a song on the Barenaked Ladies album ""Gordon"" - a great album from 1992, before BNL started making horrid, shallow, banal, cutesy music that made you want to smash your radio just to make it stop.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">73D: Steinbeck's ""To _____ Unknown"" (""a God"")</span> - Went through a Steinbeck phase as a kid. I grew up in California, so this is not that surprising. My dad, who currently lives in the heart of Steinbeck country, near the Salinas Valley, was reading ""Cannery Row"" on our recent vacation, and Sandy (wife) is reading it now (I think ... it's by the door, so I assume someone is reading it). I recognized ""To A GOD Unknown"" as a title that was lying around my house growing up but that I never read.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">105D: Two, in Lisbon (dois)</span> - had to guess the ""I"" - which was the cross for MR.
