The clue to 48A doesn't exactly stipulate his fictionality, though I guess ""stage and screen"" could imply it. I totally guessed at this answer, not knowing either the ""Y"" cross (AMY <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">- 44D: Dickens's ""Little Dorrit""</span>) or the ""O"" cross (ORAN - <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">51D: ""The Plague"" setting</span> ... I know, I should know that one by now). I've never seen ""The Producers,"" though my sister and her then-boyfriend (""then"" being the early 90's) were big fans of the 1968 movie. I thought the whole architecture was a little ungainly (a partial for a significant theme answer, a weird theme anchor - character not show - etc.), but I admire its ambitiousness and ultimate symmetry.<br /><br />No time for a full blog entry today, so just the <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">highlights</span>.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">16A: _____ Bear (Papa)</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">47D: _____ Bear (Mama)</span> - would have been better with symmetry, but still, adorable<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">23A: ""Ditat _____"" (Arizona's motto) (""Deus"")</span> - total (educated) guess at the ""U""<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">21D: Nickname aboard Apollo 1 (Gus)</span> - DEUS's ""U"" crossing, which I also didn't know<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">44A: 6'7"" TV star of 1955-75 (Arness)</span> - OK.

[The Gloria Estefan song ""Conga"" was featured on ""<a href=""http://salmongutter.blogspot.com/2007/04/american-idol-down-to-6.html"">American Idol</a>"" last week, so the word has been on my mind, much to my dismay]<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">56A: Holy book (Koran)</span> - had the -ORA- and wrote in TORAH.
