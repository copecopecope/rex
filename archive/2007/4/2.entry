In general, the fancier the theme and its architectural expression, the more disappointing the non-theme fill. Aside from the Latin phrases, and the rotational symmetry of LATIN and LOVER, there's not much to love here. I wish that all the Latin phrases, as opposed to just the first, had been Love-Related, but that's asking a lot. I like that LATIN intersects LAVA, both because LAVA kind of sounds like LOVER, and because LATIN LAVA makes me think of a particular piece of crosswordese that isn't in the grid: ETNA. It'd be nice to see VESUVIUS in the grid more often (i.e. ever).<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Latin phrases:</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">20A: Saying about the heart (amor vincit omnia)</span> - ""Love Conquers All""<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">39A: Crazy (non compos mentis)</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">57A: Outcast (persona non grata)</span><br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Brush up on your crosswordese</span><br /></div><br /><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">10A: Like show horses' feet (shod)</span></li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">69A: Instrument that's plucked (lyre)</span> - I always get LYRE and LUTE confused</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">62D: Wing-shaped (alar)</span> - you should also know AGAR</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">30D: Single-masted boat (sloop)</span> - not sure why, but this one shows up a Lot</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">7D: Secular (laic)</span> - of the laity, as opposed to the clergy</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">38D: Jacob's twin in the Bible (Esau)</span> - he gets around.
