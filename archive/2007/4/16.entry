The theme clues and answers are as follows:<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">17A: Like folks cared for by former congressman Bob? (Barr-tended)</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">10D: Like a ball retrieved by actor Jamie?

I know the name Vikki CARR, but couldn't pick her out of a line-up to save my life (that's her with the cleavage there on the left). That Ringo answer is the worst of them all, in that I don't think of ""Star-Shaped"" as a very common or in-the-language kind of word, the way that all the other theme answers are. That leaves FARR-FETCHED, which I liked. This puzzle could have appeared 30+ years ago - REBA (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">1D: McEntire of country and western</span>) is really the only answer that places this puzzle post-1980. I mean, TOM SWIFT (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">42A: Boy genius of juvenile fiction</span>)!? That came out of nowhere. I have an old TOM SWIFT book in my collection, and have stared at enough ""boys' fiction"" from last century to know the name, so I dodged this bullet, but I sure felt it whistle past my ear. And BAER (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">36A: Max of ""The Beverly Hillbillies""</span>)? Well, you see what I mean about the time warp frame of reference.<br /><br />Today is a snow day so family is home. I've never seen this much snow this late in the year, and I've lived in Michigan or NY for the past 16 years. It's like I'm paying some kind of weather penalty for having spent the past week in the gloriously temperate tropics. I had to look just now to make sure that Cancún was in fact in the tropics, and it is, just inside the Tropic of Cancer.<br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/186/461469185_9b850dc422_o.gif""><img style=""margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/186/461469185_9b850dc422_o.gif"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a><br />You can read more about the wisdom I acquired from my Mexican Vacation <a href=""http://salmongutter.blogspot.com/2007/04/club-meditations.html"">here</a>.<br /><br />As for the puzzle, I got off to a rough start, not seeing ROVER (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">1A: Gadabout</span>) and then really balking at MOMS' (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">6A: Dads' counterpart</span>) - both because it seemed far too obvious and because ""counterpart"" is singular. <a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/219/461469191_ca952e54c1_o.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/219/461469191_ca952e54c1_o.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a>I poked at MOMS' for a bit and got a cross or two, decided it must be right, then went back to the NW where I picked up the Pantheonic ENERO (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">14A: January, in Juárez</span>), which caused the NW to fall quickly. But BARR-TENDED was invisible to me, as I didn't know Bob BARR - thought the answer involved the name BARRY so had a ""Y"" where the ""T"" should have been. This gave me ROY- for the beginning of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">5D: The spit in a spit roast</span>, e.g. (rotator). Thus, I clunked around the upstairs portion of this puzzle in an awkward manner. I absolutely scorched the puzzle from there on out, but still ended up with just an average Monday time. My only other hiccup was the far west (not to be confused with Mae WEST (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">8D</span>), whom I handled just fine). As I've said, STARR-SHAPED was not a phrase that was coming to me, BAER is a bit off my radar, TOM SWIFT took a few beats to get - all of which resulted in a momentary sluggishness.<br /><br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/188/461469181_34c1f44429_o.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/188/461469181_34c1f44429_o.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a>Not a lot else to comment on. I did love <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">29A: Man of steel?</span> as a clue for CARNEGIE. O, forgot to mention that another part of the logjam of the NW was <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">21A: Book after Joel (Amos)</span>, which I had as ENOS. Turns out ENOS is not a ""book"" of the Bible, though it is a name in the geneology of Adam. I like that ENOS can be clued via the Bible, the Book of Mormon (fourth book), baseball, or short-lived TV spin-offs. AMOS would have been easier to pick up via cookies or old-time radio. Baseball's <a href=""http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=otisam01"">AMOS Otis</a> might have been too rough a way to go on a Monday.<br /><br />Must get to work.<br /><br />Signed, Rex Parker, King of CrossWorld",17,2007-04-16 08:22:00-04:00
