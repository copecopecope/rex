Didn't we have a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">double</span>-double-Z theme not too long ago, with answers like FUZZY WUZZY and (gag) HUZZAH HUZZAH? This seems to be of a lower order of difficulty, but there are still a lot of answers that make it a pleasing puzzle overall.<br /><br />The theme answers:<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">17A: Pitcher of baseball's Gas House Gang (Dizzy Dean)</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">30A: Golf's 1984 U.S. Open winner (Fuzzy Zoeller)</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">44A: Patriarch on an MTV reality show (Ozzy Osbourne)</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">60A: The Fresh Prince's partner DJ (Jazzy Jeff)</span><br /><br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/223/471207449_90412178fd_o.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/223/471207449_90412178fd_o.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a>Strangely, DIZZY DEAN - the first of these that I got - did not give me the theme, and if memory serves, I ended up in the far SE, with JAZZY JEFF, before I got another theme answer and figured out what the theme was. Not sure how I traversed the grid without picking up either FUZZY or OZZY, but there it is. I think I didn't know the former and didn't see the clue for the latter until very late. My favorite answer is JAZZY JEFF, both because it's the most out-of-left-field (all the other answers are famous in their own right, while JAZZY is famous primarily as a sidekick), and because you get not only two ""Z""s but two ""J""s. FUZZY ZOELLER gets an honorable mention for its triple-Z factor. Speaking of ""honorable mention,"" a former student of mine just won ""honorable mention"" in the <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/about/contest_winners_2007.htm""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Atlantic Monthly</span>'s student writing contest</a>, and I'm exceedingly proud of her. She doesn't attend college here anymore, sadly (for me). She now attends a University whose initials are seen not infrequently in crosswords. Hint: this school is not in Durham.<br /><br />Today's puzzle had me very frustrated at one point because - well, normally I solve all early-week puzzles in an unbroken chain of answers, working off crosses rather than jumping around to empty parts of the grid. But yesterday I hit a point where I couldn't continue in that fashion. Three different Down clues, unknown to me, kept me from being able to work my way out of the top of the puzzle and into the middle.  I had to reboot over in the ""Maryland"" portion of the puzzle somewhere (thank you, WENDY - <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">28D: ""Peter Pan"" heroine</span>). It's a rare Tuesday puzzle that can freeze me like that. The three Downs that kept me stuck:<a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/471207451_c968343181_o.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/471207451_c968343181_o.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">8D: Exotic dancer Lola (Montez) </span>- Mistress of King Ludwig I of Bavaria who somehow ends up performing exotic (i.e. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lola_Montez"">underwear-free</a>) dances for Australian miners...

I don't believe this word has ever been considered, but I don't see how you can expect to solve crosswords efficiently without it.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">25D: Russian autocrat: Var.

There seems to have been a marked uptick in ""Var.""-containing clues this year compared to last. That's just an impression - I haven't counted.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">39D: Pouty look (moue) </span>- makes a return to the grid. Appeared recently. It's a weird word I wouldn't use. Looks like a typo for MOUSE.
