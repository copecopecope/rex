Many things about this puzzle, and my initial answers, were ABSURD. Head cold persists, and so maybe that was the problem, but I could not get a hold of this puzzle for the Longest time. Coincidentally, last night I was reading through some old posts (from last year) and came across a Byron Waldon puzzle<a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/204/467182167_3f8a23029a_o.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/204/467182167_3f8a23029a_o.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a> that it took me 1 hr and 18 min. to finish! Today's didn't take me that long (I've improved some as a solver since that earlier Walden effort) but it still took me Well Longer than even your average Saturday puzzle, with much time spent staring at a pathetically partially-filled grid. I actually had that ""I'm never going to solve this"" feeling at one point, and that rarely happens anymore.<br /><br />After a lot of time and only a few sporadic entries, I finally took a look at the SE and was able to put it together in reasonable time ... only, the way the grid's constructed (NW and SE quadrants accessible only by the tiniest of apertures), my success down there gave me no additional help with the rest of the puzzle. I had already guessed the -THERAPY part of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">27D: Psychiatric discipline pioneered by Margaret Naumburg</span> - that's what got me into the SE - though I had blindly guessed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Seminars_Training"">EST</a> THERAPY (before my time, but I'm sure ""est"" is something).<br /><br />At this point, I can't even remember how I managed to finish. To give you  an idea of what kind of haze I was in by the end, I'll tell you that I had one square wrong, and you will probably never guess which. I don't mean ""wrong by sloppiness,"" I mean ""wrong, though I for some reason believed it to be right."" I will leave you to guess what that square was. No, I'll give you three options, and you tell me which intersection I blew.<a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en-commons/thumb/2/2e/200px-Hyman_Rickover_1955.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en-commons/thumb/2/2e/200px-Hyman_Rickover_1955.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/iran/images/photo5.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/iran/images/photo5.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">Option A:</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">51A: Adm.

Seems a little cruel and derisive, though, for the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Times</span>. The very name kind of demeans the sufferer a bit. Derision for the diseased is not the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Times</span>' normal M.O. Not that I'm complaining, exactly.

I'm sure there are a ""lot"" of BARS in Tijuana, but the phrasing here makes it sound as if the geographic space they take up is considerable relative to the size of the town. Maybe it is...<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">34A: Showstopper (hard act to follow)</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">33A: Like a showstopper (boffo)</span> - when's the last time you even saw the word BOFFO, let alone heard someone use it in a sentence?

Who's Rod McKuen? In my head right now, he is a cross between Rod Steiger and Rod Serling. This answer was easy to get from crosses, but I've never heard of it. Seems like Sinatra shows up a lot in Friday / Saturday puzzles. He's Sicilian, he sang a song about ""Old New York,"" etc.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">23D: Toulouse-Lautrec hangout (brothel)</span> - I had no idea. His paintings and prints are Fabulous.

No reindeer have four-letter names, so I thought of Rudolph and his NOSE - two letters right, but ultimately wrong. ENTICED seems poorly clued here. Why ""began?"" I wanted something like SKETCHED here. Oh, NAST is an illustrator who, like much of this puzzle, is before my time. He drew creepy bulbous Santas in tight-fitting pjs.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">39A: What cuirasses cover (chests)</span> - this was a gimme for me.

Sometimes, it's good to be reminded of my mortality. Speaking of mortality, MORTAL FOES (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">9D: They fight to the finish</span>) reminds me of last night's amazing Yankees / Red Sox game. Nothing in sports can compare to the awesome spectacle of these two teams going at each other. This is no hyperbole. I won't bother giving you game details, because the game has already been written up beautifully by my friend Mr. Murphy over at ""<a href=""http://tragisox.blogspot.com/"">Sophocles Was a Red Sox Fan</a>"" - a great blog deserving of wide readership, even if you're a Yankees fan. The guy loves baseball, loves his team, and he can write. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Signed, Rex Parker, King of CrossWorld",33,2007-04-21 07:43:00-04:00
