Would have amended it to ""2"" but, as usual, the NYT site froze on me when I clicked DONE, and I could not be bothered to retype the grid, so I just grabbed what I had.<br /><br />The watery celebrities are:<br /><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">20A: Captain Renault player in ""Casablanca"" (Claude Rains)</span> - I would have spelled his name RAINES</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">11D: ""Enter Talking"" autobiographer (Joan Rivers)</span></li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">29D: Singer with the 1984 hit ""Caribbean Queen"" (Billy Ocean)</span> - mmmm, high school</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">57A: Oscar nominee for ""Pinky,"" 1949 (Ethel Waters)</span> - best wrong answer of the year: I had Ethel <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merman"">MERMAN</a>  (it fits the theme!!!!)</li></ul><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">1A: Musical marks (ties)</span> - any relation to yesterday's SLURS?<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">1D: 1 on the Mohs scale (talc)</span> - now the crossword taught me what the Mohs scale was many months ago (measuring mineral hardness), but I did not learn what the various numbers signified. I guessed SOFT here at first.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">2D: One on a pedestal (idol)</span> - Last night's episode (read my write-up <a href=""http://salmongutter.blogspot.com/2007/04/american-idol-final-9.html"">here</a>) kind of sucked, but at this point it doesn't really matter because there's a sizeable buffer of terribleness between the singers I like and the person who will get kicked off the show tonight.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">4D: Break down and then draw in (seduce)</span> - possibly the hottest clue ever written.<br /><br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1991/1101910422_400.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1991/1101910422_400.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">25A: Actor Epps (Omar)</span> - Ubiquitous, and used for both his last and first name. He's this century's Paul Anka.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">37A: Nancy who married Ronald Reagan (Davis)</span> - blanked on this. DAVIS is not a memorable name, somehow. Plus, Nancy DAVIS ... sounds like somebody who is already famous for something else, though I can't think who that would be. Clearly I'm just confused.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">40A: When clocks are changed back from D.S.T. in the fall (at 2 a.m.) </span>- I had TWO AM written in here, but then figured that the theme of this puzzle (36D) could not possibly be HOO. ONE AM would have give me HEO. So I had to rethink the center of this puzzle completely. Thankfully, I already had Joan RIVERS in place, and so the H20 theme jumped out at me, giving me AT 2 AM for the Across. And that was that.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">50A: Like some stares (glassy)</span> - vivid answer. Usually stares are ICY. GLASSY is more colorful ... and more alarming. Easy to read ICY, hard to read GLASSY.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">68A: </span><a style=""font-weight: bold;"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Gould"">Jay Gould</a><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> railroad (Erie)</span> - I have no idea what this clue means, but add this to the 1000+ ways to clue ERIE list.

I don't even know who this ADELA person is. <a href=""http://www.answers.com/topic/adela-rogers-st-johns"">Wow, cool</a>, she was a ""girl reporter"" from the 20's and 30's, as well as a silent movie screenwriter and a host of other stuff.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">46D: He directed Marlon (Elia)</span> - my first thought: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenen_Ivory_Wayans"">KEENEN IVORY</a>? Sadly, no. The clue meant Marlon BRANDO, and thus the answer is ELIA Kazan. ELIA also often comes in [Lamb alias] flavor.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">56D: Certain iPod (mini)</span> - nice fakeout. I had NANO.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">60D: Bookie's worry (raid)</span> - also, insect's worry. I had ODDS.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">63D: Never, in Nuremberg (nie)</span> - always nice to pick up a little foreign language instruction in my daily puzzle. I'll had this to the ""4 German Words I Know"" list, thus changing the name of said list.<br /><br />Signed, Rex Parker, King of CrossWorld",15,2007-04-04 09:17:00-04:00
