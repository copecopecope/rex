I barely remember it now, primarily because of the intervening major excitement of last night's Yankees / Red Sox game, which was  almost too much for my still-fairly-young heart. I had two beers, which for me is binge-drinking. I had about a pound of guacamole - I stress-eat like crazy when watching sporting events. I threw my cap around the room, I jumped out of my seat shouting at the TV and slumped down in my seat cringing and high-fived people like an extra in a Miller Lite commercial. Let's see, how can I connect this to the puzzle? Oh, I know: this puzzle has four fingers in it:<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">17A: 3"" x 5"" aids for speakers (INDEX cards)</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">23A: Corporate office staffers (MIDDLE managers)</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">47A: Fonzie's girl on ""Happy Days"" (PINKY Tuscadero)</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">58A: Head of a cabal (RING leader)</span><br /><br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/209/469884879_f28edfc248_o.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/209/469884879_f28edfc248_o.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a>And I needed all four of those fingers to count the back-to-back-to-back-to-back home-runs the Red Sox hit in the third inning of last night's game (including one from AGING - <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">22D: Getting on in years</span> - third baseman Mike Lowell, whom I routinely call ""Old Man"" despite the fact that he is younger than I am). Let me recount the number of ""backs"" I wrote in there ... yep, that's right, FOUR. In a row. That hasn't happened in the A.L. in forty years (Dodgers did it in the N.L. very recently) and has only happened five times in the history of Major League Baseball. Sadly, this resulted in only a total of four runs (a single grand SLAM - <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">29A: Shut loudly</span> - could have done that), which was only enough to take a one-run lead, which we promptly lost ... but then we got it back but then the Yankees threatened but then the Sox brought in the best closer in all of baseball, creating a NO-WIN (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">25D: Hopeless, as a situation</span>) situation for the Yanks (though, truth be told, the Yanks could have gone ahead with one swing of the bat).<br /><br />I'm fairly certain that if I'd tried hard, I could have worked MESS, SPIKE, SIGNS, FOE, EKED, and AMOK into the above write-up as well.<br /><br />Before I forget, allow me to say that PINKY TUSCADERO makes me happier than any theme answer has made me in a good, long while.<br /><br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/176/469875677_e5d3ff9852_o.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/176/469875677_e5d3ff9852_o.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a><br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">5D: Deep gap (chasm)</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">15A: Worm's place, on a fishing line (hook)</span><br /><br />Last night's starting Yankee pitcher was CHASE Wright, and no, CHASE is not the same as CHASM, but it's close, and the kid certainly got the HOOK after the third inning, making CHASM / HOOK a favorite intersection of mine this morning. I also like the nearby POD (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">7D: Pea holder</span>) because the ""P"" abuts an ""A,"" giving you an L-shaped ""A-Pod"" which is like A-ROD, but missing something (like, say, the chance to get a hit when it mattered last night ... burn!). The last baseball-related thing I will say today is that I long for the day when a player named ""Alexander Orta"" enters the league so that I can revel in the experience of calling him A-ORTA (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">6D: Main artery</span>) every chance I get.<br /><br />I don't think there's a lot more to comment on in this grid. PINKY creates some interesting crosses, including a rarely seen Monday ""Var."" in NARKS (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">38D: Drug agents: Var.</span>) and the somewhat oddly spelled (and deliciously pop cultural) ELLY (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">39D: _____ May of ""The Beverly Hillbillies""</span>). <a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/469875683_b128d2fda9_o.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/469875683_b128d2fda9_o.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a>DEISM is slightly high-end for a Monday. Why is it ""Basic?"" The clue makes it sound like the answer should be a generic term (TENET, say) rather than a specific -ISM. The term LUX is familiar to me from crosswords, but I couldn't define it for you, I don't think. I mean, it's Latin for light. That would be my definition. I appreciate the ""Z"" in the NW (where GRAZES - <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">9D: Barely injures in passing</span> - meets AZURE - <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">22A: Sky-blue</span>); unthemed Scrabbliness is always appreciated.
