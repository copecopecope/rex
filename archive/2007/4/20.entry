I have a few quibbles with some of the clues and fill, but my standards are Very High for a Quarfoot puzzle, AND I solved this puzzle in the throes of the worst head cold I've had in years, so ... that should put any criticism I have in context. In general, I think that would-be constructors should study Quarfoot puzzles as models of contemporary themeless construction art.<br /><br />So I'm going to look at this puzzle in somewhat more formal terms than I do most puzzles in order to demonstrate (somewhat) precisely what features I believe make a contemporary themeless puzzle great. In the end, there is no strict formula - sometimes there's just a kind of alchemical magic that happens when you juxtapose words or clue an answer a certain way. But there are general principles. Here are some of them.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">1. Compound phrases</span> - themeless puzzles will inevitably (in the best publications, anyway) have stacks and parallel columns of fairly long answers - this puzzle has SIX different 3x7 columns and two 3x10 stacks. Notice how many of the answers in said columns / stacks are compound (that is, involve multiple words): ALL SIX of the stacked 10-letter answers (as well as one of the two unstacked 10-letter answers), and twelve of the eighteen vertical seven-letter answers. <a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/228/466152533_194b4fbd51_o.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/228/466152533_194b4fbd51_o.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a>It's probably the latter number that I find more impressive, because there are so many more 7-letter words in the language than there are 10-letter words, so while you expect to see a good degree of compoundness in the 10s, to see that high a degree in the 7s is remarkable. What makes compoundness good? It's all about parsing - trying to figure out what the answer is, how many words are involved, where words break, whether there are hyphens involved, etc. Having lots of compound answers adds a level of excitement and variety to the puzzle, so that the difficulty resides not (just) in the obscurity of the answer, but in getting your brain to be supple enough to tease out an answer. Compound answers can simply be way more tricky to see than single-word answers during the course of solving because even if you have some crosses, you can't be sure what relation those letters will have to one other. Take ONE-MAN ARMY (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">15A: Versatile combatant</span>). I had --E-AN ARMY for a bit and all I could think was that ""--E-AN"" was one word, like, I don't know, CRETAN. I think your brain instinctively wants to see the answer as a single unit, and you have to will it into seeing / considering breaks and disjunctures. This is how it is for me, anyway. Compound answers add an extra facet to the challenge of solving, one that takes you beyond the question of whether or not you know something to the question of whether or not you can see something.<br /><br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/William_wordsworth.jpg/180px-William_wordsworth.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/William_wordsworth.jpg/180px-William_wordsworth.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">2. Breadth of vision</span> - part of what makes fill ""fresh"" or ""lively"" (words I've used often) is the imaginative exploitation of the space in a long answer. The closer you stick to one-word fill, the more limited you are in your options, so every constructor's going to have to go compound to a certain extent; but the best puzzles have a certain fearlessness about the multiple-word phrase and its ability to take you into the language of the everyday world (contemporary, in-the-language phrases and ideas and names that are not necessarily dictionary-worthy). I have this ridiculous urge to compare Quarfoot (and I would say Shortz, insofar as he fosters and encourages this kind of thing) to the poet William Wordsworth, particularly where Wordsworth's commitment to the ""language of men"" is concerned. The following is from Wordsworth's very famous ""Preface to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lyrical Ballads</span>"" (1798):<br /><blockquote>There will also be found in these volumes little of  what is usually called poetic diction; I have taken as much  pains to avoid it as others ordinarily take to produce it;  this I have done for the reason already alleged, to bring my  language near to the language of men, and further,  because  the pleasure which I have proposed to myself to impart is of  a kind very different from that which is supposed by many  persons to be the proper object of poetry.</blockquote>Now Wordsworth, when talking about ""the language of men,"" most likely did not have something like TOYS 'R' US KID (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">1A: One who doesn't want to grow up, in a jingle</span>) in mind. Too crassly commercial for one who worshipped at the altar of Nature. But still - the rejection of a certain formal, staid, self-consciously erudite aesthetic in favor of a more populist aesthetic strikes me as admirably democratic, and a wonderful way of isolating and bringing out the beauty in words and phrases we see and utter every day:<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">UPC CODE</span> - 34D: Bars from a store<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">FLU SHOT </span>- 12D: Seasonal safeguard<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">SAT IN ON </span>- 7D: Audited<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">PET NAME </span>- 37D: Muffin, for one<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">AIR WAVE</span> - 13D: Broadcasting unit?<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">ON BOARD</span> - 2D: Participating in a group<br /><br />That said, the best puzzles will still reserve the right to Get Medieval (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">45D: ""Le Morte d'Arthur"" author (Malory)</span>), or even Ancient Roman (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">60A: Berlioz opera based on Virgil's ""Aeneid"" (""Les Troyens"")</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">52A: Golden Age writer (Ovid)</span>), on your ass. That's why I say ""breadth of vision"" is important - you don't ditch the old for the new, you just mix them up in unexpected ways.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">3. Supple Joints</span> - big stacks and columns are of course the bread-and-butter of a themeless puzzle. They're showy, ostentatious, impressive. But what about the answers that move you from quadrant to quadrant, from showcase to showcase - the three- and four-letter answers that connect the wide-open spaces that we know and love? In the best themeless puzzles, these answers will be both tricky and colorful, not throwaway answers or tired standards. Now not every answer in a puzzle can be scintillating, so I can forgive some blandness in the joints, but a perfect puzzle does not treat the joints as unimp0rtant way-stations. In today's puzzle, for instance, we even get some Scrabbly letters (another key ingredient in a stellar themeless) in the joints:<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">DR. X</span> (33A: Bogart's only horror film title role, 1939) crosses<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">CRUX</span> (25D: Meat) and<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">OJOS</span> (24D: Optometría concern) crosses<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">JOIN</span> (27A: Make one).<br /><br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/193/466152529_442367d166_o.jpg""><img style=""margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/193/466152529_442367d166_o.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a>The worst answer in today's joints was MUS. (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">32A: Where hangings are witnessed: Abbr.</span>) both because it's a bad abbreviation (i.e. one you are not likely ever to see) and because that ""hangings"" clue, which was probably once tricky, is getting old. But that's one of only a few duds in this puzzle. Take your short answers seriously! They're part of the puzzle too. If you look at the short answers in the SW of today's puzzle ... not much to love, but if you look at the SE: MOME (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">45A: ""And the _____ raths outgrabe"" (""Jabberwocky"" line)</span>) over APIA (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">48A: Capital on Upolu island</span>) over LTDS (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">51A: Old Fords</span>)?  Nice. Also, in the NW, SOIR (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">19A: Matin's opposite</span>) over TATE (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Larry or Louise on ""Bewitched""</span>) over ERIS (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">26A: Harmonia's antithesis</span>)? Lovely, especially given the ""Bewitched""-oriented cluing for TATE (so much better than a MUSeum- or Manson-oriented clue).<br /><br />Which reminds me: I have left cluing out of today's discussion for the most part, focusing mainly on the composition of the grid. Cluing is of course important - vital, even - to the quality of the puzzle-solving experience.  But I find I have far fewer specific opinions about what a clue should be than I do about how a grid should look.<br /><br />I have never constructed a puzzle in my life, so feel free to throw all my opinions straight out the window.<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">A few final notes:</span><br /></div><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">17A: Popular '90s workout video (""Abs of Steel"")</span> - Genius.

Reminded me of the Amazing comic <span style=""font-style: italic;"">We3</span> (Grant Morrison / Frank Quitely), which I just finished teaching in my Comics course. It features three domestic animals (dog, cat, bunny) who have been programmed by the government not only to be very efficient killing machines, but also to speak in a very, very rudimentary, computer-ese kind of way. That invented language is alternately hilarious and touching, and one of the book's great charms.
