Straight over the plate. Ably but not excitingly filled. It's a Monday puzzle. It happened. And though the core theme concept isn't eye-popping, the resulting theme answers (six of them!) are at least interesting. I can verify that puppies do indeed love <b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;"">BELLY RUB</span></b>s (<b>42A: Activity a puppy loves</b>). As do dogs. As do some people. I flew through this, with one notable sticking point—see, I got <b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;"">BILLY BOB </span>(20A: Actor Thornton of ""Sling Blade"")</b>, and then got <b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;"">B AND B</span></b>, and so (not having read the<b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;""> B AND B</span></b> clue thoroughly) I assumed that each word in the phrase would *start* with ""B.""&nbsp;(I must've gone through <b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;"">BELLY RUB</span></b> by that point, but somehow that didn't disabuse me of my incorrect assumption).&nbsp;Anyway, imagining the Bs would start both words in the phrase meant that when I got to <b>18A: Group that includes North, South, East and West</b>, I had double-trouble. First, I'd made an incorrect assumption about the theme, and second, bridge??? I know nothing about bridge. I honestly don't even know what a <b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;"">BRIDGE CLUB</span></b> is. I know a game of bridge has ESNW positions, but I don't know how ""club"" fits in. Is it the normal meaning of club? And if so, isn't saying a <b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;"">BRIDGE CLUB</span></b> includes NSEW a bit like saying a book club includes words? As you can see, I'm out of my depth with bridge. Anyway, I had BRIDGE (easy) but then put in a B for the next letter and promptly got stuck. Also, imagined answer could be BRIDGE BETS. Eventually just solved the short stuff in that NE corner and everything worked itself out. Rest of the grid was a snap.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/TRf80kx1AOI"" width=""420""></iframe></center><br /><span style=""color: #500b00; font-weight: bold;"">Other theme answers:</span> <br /><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">51A: Service provided at Meineke and Pep Boys (BRAKE JOB)</span></li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">55A: Sparring injury, perhaps (BRUISED RIB)</span></li></ul><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HDAWnHHmMis/T53KHYRNRmI/AAAAAAAAMqM/hfHu1DAh8k8/s1600/rsd-2012.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""156"" src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HDAWnHHmMis/T53KHYRNRmI/AAAAAAAAMqM/hfHu1DAh8k8/s200/rsd-2012.jpg"" width=""200"" /></a></div>Sales of new vinyl are actually up in recent years, so the ""Old"" part of <b>27D: Old LPs and 45s </b>is patently unnecessary (actually, even if sales weren't up, it would be unnecessary). Everyone has some bit of tired, short fill they find particularly irksome. I have never thought about ranking said fill in terms of how much it bugs me, but I think if I could get rid of one short answer—just abolish it from all future puzzles—it would be <b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;"">ENNE</span></b>. I do this on two counts—first, it's a suffix, and no one (least of all the constructor) actually *wants* suffixes in a grid. They are always a last resort. So, there's that. But <b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;"">ENNE</span></b> is particularly annoying because its most common clue (today's [<b>Feminine suffix</b>]), can be two things: ETTE or <b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;"">ENNE</span></b>. So you can't just write it in, move on, and *forget* about it (which is all anyone wants to do with a suffix). You have to actually work crosses. Now, I'm not opposed to work, but I am opposed to working for *that*. For no payoff. When crud adds *any* level of difficulty, it stands out more and irks more. ""We're gonna make this puzzle a little more challenging by yanking one of your hairs out at the two-minute mark, OK?"" That might actually be preferable to encountering <b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;"">ENNE</span></b> again.<br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/7OgV4F7JzVc"" width=""500""></iframe></center><br />Please understand that I'm not faulting this puzzle for containing <b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;"">ENNE</span></b>. *Lots* of puzzles have contained <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;""><b>ENNE,</b></span>&nbsp;some of them quite fine, I'm sure. I'm just saying that if I had a magic wand, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;""><b>ENNE</b></span> would disappear. Forever.<br /><br />Clue-wise, <b>10D: Something always sold in mint condition? (<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;"">TIC TAC</span>) </b>is the big winner by far (despite the fact that there are non-mint <b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #351c75;"">TIC TAC</span></b>s; I like the orange).<br /><br />Oh, also, [<b>Cheese popular with crackers</b>]? That's pretty racist.<br /><br />[emoticon indicating lack of seriousness]<br /><br />Signed, Rex Parker, King of CrossWorld",85,2012-04-30 00:00:00-04:00
